# Library_System_Assignment

Context

The library wishes to hire you to develop their application that will be used to manage their book resources. The system will be accessed by the admin, the librarian, students, staff and faculties. Each category of users has privileges that are different from another category. The admin accounts have super controller privileges (managing users and privileges), the librarian will be given privileges to record|update|read|delete, assign a borrowed book (lend a book), clear the borrowed book from the student/faculty who borrowed it upon its return. The students, staffs and faculties search for a book (available or not available), they can also see the list of books they have been lent so far with their states (returned or not returned).
